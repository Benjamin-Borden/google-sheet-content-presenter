# google-sheet-content-presenter

A little script for Apps Script for taking content inside a spreadsheet and sending it to a linked Google Doc. I use it with my DnD campaign to send content from my DM notes to an "Adventure Log" google doc for my players to keep track of information I've given them, characters they've met, etc etc
